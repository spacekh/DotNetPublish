# DotNetPublish
Small GUI dotnet publish client for those who hate the CLI (or can't remember the switches, like me)

Select a source folder (the left browse... button), select a destination, publish.

Plenty of room to improve:
Currently only outputs EXEs for win-x64; someone could add a dropdown for other choices.
Sorry it's not very intuitive; I'm a programmer, not a designer.  I'm sure someone could make it prettier.
