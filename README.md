# DotNetPublish
Small GUI dotnet publish client for those who hate the CLI (or can't remember the switches, like me)

Select a source folder (the left browse... button), select a destination, choose a version (defaults to win-x64), publish.

It's maybe not very intuitive; I'm a programmer, not a designer.  I'm sure someone could make it prettier.
